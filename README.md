# Voice-Activated Assistant

This project implements a voice-activated assistant that listens to user commands, processes them using OpenAI's GPT model, and responds with spoken and textual output. It uses libraries like `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, and `openai` to provide an interactive and conversational experience.

---

## Features
- **Voice Input**: Listens to user commands through the microphone.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Processes commands using OpenAI's GPT model to generate intelligent replies.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Speaks responses back to the user for a conversational experience.
- **Exit Functionality**: Allows users to exit the assistant by saying "exit" or "stop".

---

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API Key
- A microphone-enabled device
- Required Python libraries installed (see below)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-assistant.git
   cd voice-assistant
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. Ensure your microphone is set up and working.

---

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python assistant.py
   ```

2. Speak your command when prompted.

3. To exit, say "exit" or "stop".

## Project Structure

- `assistant.py`: Main script containing the assistant logic.
- `.env`: File to store your OpenAI API key securely.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.

---

## Libraries Used

- `speech_recognition`: For capturing and recognizing voice input.
- `pyttsx3`: For converting text-to-speech.
- `openai`: For interacting with OpenAI's GPT API.
- `dotenv`: For securely loading API keys from environment variables.

---

## Notes

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for OpenAI API requests.
- Configure the OpenAI model (`gpt-4o-mini`) as per your subscription and requirements.
- Test your microphone setup before running the project.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Microphone Not Detected**:  
   Check your microphone settings and ensure it is properly connected.

2. **API Key Error**:  
   Make sure your `.env` file is correctly set up with a valid API key.

3. **Speech Recognition Timeout**:  
   If the assistant times out while listening, ensure you're speaking clearly and adjust the `timeout` value in the script if needed.
